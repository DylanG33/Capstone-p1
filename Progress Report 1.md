# Progress Report 1

## Summary

This week, I have conducted foundational research on phishing attack trends and DNS-based protection mechanisms to establish the rationale for this project. The important steps and deliverables are:

* Analyzed current phishing statistics from Proofpoint's 2024 State of the Phish Report showing sustained high click rates despite security awareness training
* Reviewed APWG Q1 2024 data documenting record-high phishing attack volumes with financial services and SaaS platforms as primary targets
* Examined Verizon's 2024 DBIR findings linking phishing to majority of data breaches as initial access vector
* Researched DNS-level blocking advantages over browser-based solutions including device-agnostic protection and centralized management
* Identified Response Policy Zones (RPZ) as the standard mechanism for DNS-based threat blocking used by enterprises

Research confirms that phishing remains a critical threat and DNS-based blocking offers a viable protection layer worth investigating.
