# Progress Report 3

## Summary

This week, I have researched experimental design methodologies and identified appropriate testing frameworks for evaluating DNS-based phishing protection effectiveness:

* Reviewed quasi-experimental pretest-posttest designs to establish valid comparison methodology for measuring blocking effectiveness
* Researched DNS performance testing tools and measurement techniques including query resolution timing
* Analyzed case studies of DNS-based security implementations in enterprise environments to understand real-world deployment
* Developed testing protocol incorporating both controlled VM testing and limited real-world validation with volunteer users
